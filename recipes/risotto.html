<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Risotto is one of my favorite recipes.</p>
<p>I make it at least once a week! It can seem like a difficult dish to master,
    but once you master it you will look forward to making it.</p>
<h3>Ingredients you will need:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Arborio Rice</li>
    <li>White Wine</li>
    <li>Tomatos</li>
    <li>Tomato Paste (optional)</li>
    <li>Italian Seasonings</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step-By-Step</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Dice your Onion</li>
    <li>Mince Garlic</li>
    <li>Once your pan is hot, add your Onion & Garlic. Cook until soft.</li>
    <li>After the Onion & Garlic is soft, add your rice. Cook until brown or a nutty smell starts to emit from the pan.</li>
    <li>After your rice is browned, add your white wine and stir regularly until it has been absorbed by the rice.</li>
    <li>Once the wine has been absorbed, add your tomatos and chicken stock.</li>
    <li>continue to add chicken stock one cup at a time until the rice is fully cooked.</li>
    <li>Once the rice is fully cooked, season to taste and add parmesan cheese.</li>
</ol>
<p>And just like that, your Risotto is complete! Great job!</p>
